# Thesis
Classification using State of the art algorithms and ensemble algorithms in scRNA seq.
The purpose of this thesis is to compare and find the best suitable algorithm for single cell RNA sequence datasets. We compare the state of the art algorithms like {XGBoost,LightGBM and Catboost,} and the ensemble algorithms {Adaboost, Bagging, ExtraTrees, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, Voting, Stacking}  .
More about the results and the conclusion read my thesis.
